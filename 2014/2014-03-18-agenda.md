Are we now moving to new member procedure laid out in articles of
association?

Iain and Tom were volunteered to make this happen. 

## Marketting materials

Iain was to make posters.

# Make It Glo workshop

Will have happened by the time of the meeting. There will be an after
action report here.

# Hack'n'Make

Happening on Sunday 11th May. 

We will have space to show off projects and/or run workshop(s). 

There are plans afoot to run a workshop making a badge from our logo. 

Tom is coordinating. 

# Rack
We have a new rack. There is stuff in it.
Keys/3D printed handle?
Documentation is on the wiki page.

# Compute cluster
We still have one. It still needs some work to make it do stuff.

# Break in

The space was broken into. More details at http://adventurist.me/posts/0016 

We are looking at making it harder for this to happen again, and
adding some recording from cameras covering at least the door to give
a record if it does.

There are now keys for the front door in the space (on a hook by the
door attached to some old RAM) - if you're the last person out please
take one and lock the door when you leave, then take the key back next
time you're in.

# Joining Make Aberdeen 

We could get a small business membership of Make Aberdeen to give all
members of 57N access to the Make machines at member.

# Cooperation with Satrosphere

At the Satrosphere take over night one of the folks there expressed an
interest in looking at ways we could team up with them to do stuff
(hold workshops, have our own take over night, other).

# Central hub for photos/media

Could do with a canonical place to collect photos and other media
related to the space.

Could use a Flickr group. 

Shell suggested MediaGoblin http://mediagoblin.org/

# Themed Thursdays

These have been happening. More are planned. 

Could do with getting them onto the calendar and promoted to other places. 

Also the list on the website is static so finding then next one means
you need to know the current date and do a bit of reading. Could do
with a volunteer to make the list automatically updated (and that
volunteer might have to be Iain).
