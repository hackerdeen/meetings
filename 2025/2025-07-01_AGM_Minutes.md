### 5) Removal of requirement for an AGM [hackerdeen/articles#17]

This was the first of two proposals for changes to the articles to simplify the working of the organisation, proposed by Alex.

Rob mentioned the announcement of the proposal of changes was not made in sufficient time (re item 39 and 41.1 of the articles) and could not really be considered at the AGM.

There was an agreement in principle that simplification would be a positive thing, and we should try and do this in time for the next AGM or have an EGM re this.

Proposal not approved.
